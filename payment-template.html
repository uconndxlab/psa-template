        <p class="med">2. FORCE MAJEURE: If the Contractor's performance is rendered impossible or hazardous or is otherwise prevented or impaired due to sickness, accident, interruption or failure of means 
            of transportation, Act(s) of God, riots, strikes, labor difficulties, epidemics, earthquakes, and/or any other cause or event, similar or dissimilar, beyond the control of the Contractor or University, 
            then each party's obligations to the other under this Agreement shall be excused and neither party shall have any liability to the other under or in connection with this Agreement. For purposes of this 
            document, a declaration of a state of emergency by the Governor of the State of Connecticut shall constitute a condition beyond the reasonable control of the University.</p>

        <p class="med">3. CANCELLATION OF IN-PERSON ACTIVITIES BY UNIVERSITY: In the event of a force majeure circumstance or a recommendation by i) the Governor or ii) the State of Connecticut or iii) the University 
            that affects the University's ability to continue in-person activities, both parties agree to reschedule to the first date and time that is mutually agreeable to bothsides. If the event cannot be rescheduled to a mutually agreed</p>

        <p class="med">4. UNIVERSITY POLICIES: The Contractor shall, at no additional cost to the University, comply with all policies and procedures of the University. Current policies are available at 
            http://policy.uconn.edu/ and include, without limitation, the University's smoking policy available at http://policy.uconn.edu/2011.06.02/smoking/. In the event the University establishes
            new policies or procedures following issuance of this Agreement, or makes modifications to policies or procedures in existence at the time of such issuance, the Contractor shall comply with such new 
            or modified policies or procedures upon written notice. Contractor and/or Artist shall be given a notice regarding any alleged breach.</p>

        <p class="med">5. WITHHOLDING TAXES: The Connecticut State Department of Revenue Services has issued Policy Statement PS 2018(1) regarding Income Tax Withholding for Athletes and Entertainers under the 
            Connecticut General Statue 12-705. The University of Connecticut therefore is required to withhold CT Income Tax at the maximum applicable rate where the aggregate annual gross payment exceeds $1,000.00. 
            The Department of Revenue Services (860) 541-4550 can grant a reduction or elimination of the withholding, but the paperwork must be initiated by the Contractor. NOTE: Contract and W-9 should be forwarded to 
            the University; withholding forms sent to the Department of Revenue Services.</p>
        
        <p class="med">6. COUNTERPARTS: This Contract or Amendment (as the case may be) may be executed in counterparts, and each counterpart shall have the same force and effect as an original and, when taken together, 
            shall constitute one and the same instrument and an effective binding agreement on the part of each of the undersigned. Execution of a facsimile or PDF copy shall have the same force and effect as execution of 
            an original. Signed copies of this Contract may be faxed and e-mailed with the same force and effect as if the originally executed Agreement had been delivered.</p>

        <p class="med">7. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: This written Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement of the parties and no other terms and conditions in any document, acceptance or acknowledgements shall be effective or 
            binding unless expressly agreed to in writing by the University. This Agreement may not be changed other than by a formal written amendment signed by the parties hereto. </p>
